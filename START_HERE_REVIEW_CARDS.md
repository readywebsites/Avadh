## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Images First** - Update the 6 guest photos first (most impactful)
2. **Test Mobile** - Phone experience is key, test early
3. **Keep Gold** - The #c9a227 gold color is perfect, consider keeping it
4. **Adjust Tilt** - If 15° feels too much, reduce to 12° or 10°
5. **Monitor Performance** - Use DevTools Performance tab
6. **Gather Feedback** - Real user feedback will help refine

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Cards not tilting | Check CSS/JS loaded (see console) |
| Missing animations | Verify all files linked |
| Mobile not responsive | Clear cache + hard refresh |
| Dark mode not working | Check browser setting |
| Slow performance | Check GPU, reduce shadow complexity |
